•	Number system and conversion between different bases.  
•	File handling
•	Looping and control structures (for, while, do while loops.) 
•	Conditional statements (if, else if, switch case)
•	Standard library functions, user-invokable functions
•	User defined input
•	Header files
•	Pointers
•	Arrays and strings
•	Data types such as char, void, long int, etc. 
•	Input and Output handling
•	Error handling
•	Comments and documentation
